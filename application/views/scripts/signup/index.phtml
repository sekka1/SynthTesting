U. General Provisions
1. All waivers must be in writing. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision or any other right or provision on any other occasion.
2. If any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable, that provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of the provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
3. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.
4. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be considered an original, but all of which together constitute the same instrument.
5. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you.
6. The laws of your country may be different from those of California and the United States in numerous respects. There is no practical way for Company to monitor the laws of every country in detail. You accept sole responsibility for the legality of your actions under laws applying to you.
7. Any pre-printed terms on your purchase order are expressly rejected by Company and will be given no force or effect.
8. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., without regard to California’s conflict-of-laws principles.

The parties agree that any claim asserted in any legal proceeding by one party against the other will be commenced and maintained exclusively in the courts of Santa Clara County or the Northern District of California. Both parties hereby submit to the jurisdiction of such courts over each of them personally in connection with such litigation, and waive any objection to venue in such courts and any claim that such forum is an inconvenient forum.
9. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Company and governs your use of the Company Services, superseding any prior agreements or contemporaneous agreements between you and Company.
10. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Company Services, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service.
11. Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of this Agreement, at any time.

Your continued use of the Company Services following the posting of changes will mean that you accept and agree to the changes. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Company Services.
12. Violation of any of the terms above will result in the termination of your Company account.
